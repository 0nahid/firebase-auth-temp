# Getting Started with Create React App

# On This project we will be using [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) to create our project.

# We'll use firebase to host our project.

# We'll use [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) to manage our project.

# This is Just a templeate that you can use on your any build earlier or future build.

# We appreciate your pull support.
